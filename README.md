# Community-Connect

## Description

The Community Connect web application provides an easy and convenient way for people to connect to their neighbors, plan local events, keep up with local news, and start community donation drives. 

The application allows users to create both an admin account to manage their local neighborhood as well as normal user accounts to participate in neighborhood events.  When users create an account, they are able to create posts, events, photos, and donation drives.
